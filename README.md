# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scala and Spark [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Microservices with Spring Boot 2.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-machine-learning-scala-and-spark-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789342468), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Programmers face multiple challenges while implementing ML; dealing with unstructured data and picking the proper ML model are among the hardest.

In this course we will go through day-to-day challenges that programmers face when implementing ML pipelines and consider different approaches and models to solve complex problems.

You will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques and implement them in your favor. You will implement algorithms in practical hands-on projects, building data models and understanding how they work by using different types of algorithm.

Each section of the course deals with a specific machine learning problem and analysis and gives you insights by using real-world datasets.

By the end of this course, you will be able to take huge datasets, extract features from it, and apply a machine learning model that is well suited to your problem.
